# Dambel - Logo
This is the initial version of the **Dambel** logo.

It may seem unusual, but it was designed using **HTML and CSS** to keep it super minimalistic and simple. You can extract the image by simply taking a screenshot of the specific `<div>` element in the browser.

## Code Usage

To work with and generate different sizes of the Dambel logo, follow these steps:

1. **Install requirements**:

4. **Generate Different Sizes**:

     ```bash
     python3 generate.py
     ```
